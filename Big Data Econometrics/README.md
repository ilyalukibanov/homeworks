# Big Data Econometrics
This folder contains the solutions to Big Data Econometrics assignments and a project. The first two assignments and the project were submitted as a team. The assignment were pretty easy, so we individually solved them first and then combined them into team files. We used the standard packages to solve the assignments: NumPy, Pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, scipy, and causalinference (written by the instructor). 

## Topics by assignments:
1. Matrix multiplication complexity, Linear Regression, PCA, KMeans
2. Decision Trees Regressor, BaggingRegressor (with Trees as base functions), RandomForestRegressor, XGBRegressor
3. Propensity Score Matching, SVD, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes

## Causal Random Forest Project:
* Implemented Causal Forest as my part of the project
* Investigated the results: plotted treatment effect distribution, compared the pre-treament characteristics for positive and negative treatment effects
